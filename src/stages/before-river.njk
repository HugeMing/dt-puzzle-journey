            I'm glad to have figured out that message left for me by my whƒÅnau.
            I have successfully found the secret path and made it to the river.

            That storm last week has washed away the crossing.
            The river is too swift to cross, so I'm going to have to make a new bridge.
            At least by rebuilding the bridge, other people will be able to use it too.

            I can see some spare coils of rope, but the individual lengths are too short to span the river.
            I'm going to have to join them together.
